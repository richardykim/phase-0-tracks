# Method to create a list
# input: string of items separated by spaces (example: "carrots apples cereal pizza")
# steps: 
  # Split string into an array
  # Take each item in array and add to our hash
  # set default quantity
  # print the list to the console [puts, p, print]
# output: hash


def create_list(items)
	shopping_list={}
	items.split.each do |item|
		shopping_list[item] = 1
	end
	p shopping_list
end


# Method to add an item to a list
# input: list, item name, and optional quantity
# steps: 
	# The list is a hash
	# We can add a new item as a key and an optional quantity as a value
# output: hash with new item

def add_item(list, item_name, quantity = 1)
	list[item_name] = quantity
	list
end


# Method to remove an item from the list
# input: list and item name
# steps:
	# The list is a hash
	# We can remove an item in the list by calling its name
# output: hash with item removed

def remove_item(list, item_name)
	list.delete(item_name)
	list
end


# Method to update the quantity of an item
# input: list, item name, and quantity
# steps:
	# The list is a hash
	# We can find the item in the list and change the quantity of that item 
# output: hash with item quantity changed

def update_quantity(list, item_name, quantity)
	list[item_name] = quantity.to_i
	list
end


# Method to print a list and make it look pretty
# input: list
# steps: 
	# print each key and value together in separate lines
# output: hash of current version of list


def print_list(list)
	list.each do |item, quantity|
		puts "We need #{quantity} #{item}"
	end
end



## DRIVER CODE

# puts my_list

# p update_quantity(my_list, "pizza", 3)
# puts my_list

# print_list(my_list)

add_item(my_list, "Ice Cream", 4)
puts my_list

# REFLECTION

# This challenge really opened my perspective on the need for specific pseudocoding. Our guide explained that when many people are working on the same project, many times pseudocodes would help clarify what everyone's aims would be. 

# Using a Hash was helpful for this challenge because we dealt with items and their quantities. Arrays would have been more useful if we only were to deal with one or the other. 

# A method returns the last line of the method, unless if it is specifically told to return something else. 

# You are able to pass variables through methods as arguments. 

# To pass information between methods, you can call the same variables through them by putting it into their arguments.

# This gps session helped clarify the importance of pseudocoding, the difference in p, puts, and prints, and it was generally a good review.
