What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
The purpose of HTML5 semantic tags is to make an HTML page more readable and accessible to people with disabilities. I find them all very useful, but I especially find the main tag, article tag, and nav tag very helpful.


What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
The order the browser uses to display elements on a page is typically from top to bottom of the HTML file. The browswer usually starts from the head tag and moves down to the body.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
I learned that sublime is a powerful tool that can help make coding more efficient by the program's ability to create snippets. I will definitely create many more snippets later on.

What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
I think the semantic elements of this challenge was the most difficult. It was difficult to visualize it, but I liked that we were given the opportunity to work through each element. I believe more practice could have been more helpful to me.
