# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is a system that allows users to view all the changes made to one or a set of files. It is an extremely useful tool beause it records the history of all the changes made and allows users to go back to a save point.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is a copy of a master project that a user may work on. People use branches so they can work on projects without affecting the main trunk. This allows for multiple users to work on the same project at once, which maximizes efficiency. 

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is almost like a save point in your project. A user is able to commit his file and by doing so, he can go back to this point to review what changes have been made. A goot commit message is one that is very specific to the changes that have been made; this minimizes room for confusion for users, especially when there are many people involved in the project.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict occurs when two or more branches are modified in a way that contradict each other. One user may have worked on a branch and deleted one line, while another user working on another branch simply modified the line. When these two branches are merged a merge conflict is created.
