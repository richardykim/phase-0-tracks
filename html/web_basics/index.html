	<h2>All About Seals</h2>
	<strong>Description</strong>
	<br> Seals are carnivorous semi-aquatic marine mammals that live primarily in the polar and subpolar regions of the world. They spend the majority of their lives in water feeding mostly on fish and cephalopods. Though very cute and harmless looking at first glance, they are strong predators that eat their prey whole. Prey that are too large to eat at once are brought to the surface to be torn apart. Seals themselves are subject to predation, usually targeted by the killer whale or orca.  </br>
